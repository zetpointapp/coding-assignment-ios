# The ZetPoint App's iOS Coding Challenge
Hello!üëã We are exited to see you here!

This document describes one of the challenges for those interested in working with us. As you may have guessed, it revolves around the iOS development. üéâ

## The Challenge
A client reached out to us with an idea of creating a weather app. They want to create the weather app that suits their desires. They've already came up with the list of the app requirements. The user should be able to:
* show current weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind and the weather status (clear, cloudy, rain, show and etc.),
* browse the 7-days forecast,
* get weather for the current user location,
* choose city,
* show an hourly weather forecast for the current day,
* save the current day weather to show when the user is offline,
* implement iPad support.

Quite a list! üò±

Luckily, there's a great weather service available to ease some of the bullet points. 
* [Current Weather Data API](https://openweathermap.org/current) - provides you access to the current weather data for any location on Earth. 
* [One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) - can be used to get all essential weather data for a specific location like current weather, hourly forecast for 48 hours, daily forecast for 7 days.

Still, does they expect all this in the first iteration?

## The Task
Given the amount of work, the client has agreed to an [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product).

This is where we need you! üéâ

Your task is to pick a few features you think are best suited for an MVP. The tech stack is completely up to you - any third party libraries and tools you need to get the job done. Considering this is the MVP, your code should be architectured in a way that makes it easy to add and extend features.

Also, the client doesn't have a budget for a designer. They don't expect anything fancy, but they trust you to come up with something reasonable.

## The Review
Please include a README file with a quick and dirty description of your solution, the thought process, and any points you'd like to highlight. It will help us during the review, where we'll look at:

* your VCS history, with hopefully more than 1 commit,
* the project structure,
* the project architecture,
* good coding practices,
* consistent coding style and formatting,
* namings and naming conventions,
* good use of comments.

## The End
Good luck with the task! We really appreciate the time and effort it took to complete the task! ‚ù§Ô∏è We promise to return the favor as best as we can.
